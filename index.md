---

Mathematics is universal, which can make it seem other-worldly and out of reach from everyday life. The <b>Maths At The Human Scale (MATHS) Lab</b> embraces a human-centered approach to study how mathematics interacts with the body at all levels - from neurons to neighbourhoods. We research how numbers are encoded in the brain, as well as the mechanisms that drive individual differences in maths learning behaviours.<br>

By better understanding how we construct mental models of maths knowledge, <b>our goal is to ultimately make learning maths more effective, enjoyable, and accessible for all</b>.<br>
