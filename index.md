---

Mathematics is universal, which can make it seem other-worldly and out of reach from everyday life. The <b>Maths At The Human Scale (MATHS) Lab</b> embraces a human-centered approach to study how mathematics interacts with the body at all levels. We research how numbers are encoded in the brain, as well as the mechanisms that drive individual differences in maths learning behaviours.<br>

By better understanding how we construct mental models of maths knowledge, <b>our goal is to ultimately make learning maths more effective, enjoyable, and accessible for all</b>.<br>
