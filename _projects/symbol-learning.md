This research aims to better understand why some people find it easier or harder to use symbols (for example, the digits 1 to 9) for tasks like ordering, spacing, and comparing numbers, as well as using these symbols to add and subtract numbers. We will recruit people who find learning maths difficult, as well as those who find maths enjoyable. Over separate days participants will learn to use a new set of symbols to order, space, and compare numbers, as well as using these symbols for addition and subtraction. Participants will also have their brain scanned using an MRI machine.
