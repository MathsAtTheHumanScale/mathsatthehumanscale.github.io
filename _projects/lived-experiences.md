Did you find learning mathematics in school to be a bad experience? Do you have difficulty using numbers and basic maths in your daily life? Do you avoid maths puzzles and games (e.g., Sudoku, 2048, dominos)? If so, we would like to understand your experiences with maths in our research project, which aims to study the strategies you use when dealing with numbers and maths every day.

If you live in Australia, are 18 years or older, and would like to participate, click here to <!--learn more [hyperlink to the Plain Language Statement].-->
