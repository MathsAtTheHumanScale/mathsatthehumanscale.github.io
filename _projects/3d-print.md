One of the advantages of using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for research, is that we often acquire a high-resolution structural image of the brain to identify cortical landmarks and map the spatial location of neural activity. We are fortunate to have access to an ultra-high-field 7 Tesla MRI scanner at the Melbourne Brain Centre Imaging Unit within the University of Melbourne, which produce extremely detailed anatomical T1 weighted images.

From these high-resolution images we can create STL files that are required for 3D printing. I follow the step-by-step guide outlined here: <b>[https://github.com/miykael/3dprintyourbrain](https://github.com/miykael/3dprintyourbrain)</b>

After a few hours of printing, this produces a 3D print of your unique brain.
