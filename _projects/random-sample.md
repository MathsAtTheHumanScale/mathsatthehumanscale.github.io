<b>Summary from The Random Sample Podcast:</b>

EPISODE 94<br>
UNDERSTANDING MATHS STRUGGLES – WITH DR JACOB PAUL<br>
Why do some people struggle with maths?<br>

In this episode, we chat with Dr Jacob Paul from The University of Melbourne’s School of Psychological Sciences, where he leads the Maths at Human Scale Lab. The focus of his research is to understand maths learning disorders, including something called dyscalculia.

Jacob tells us what it means for children and adults with dyscalculia and what that looks like in their lives. Plus, what he’s doing to raise awareness and improve support for people who struggle with it. 

Our host is Cynthia Huang, a PhD Candidate at Monash University in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics.
