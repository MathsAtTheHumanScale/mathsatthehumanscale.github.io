A necessary consequence of collecting data within an MRI scanner is that the participant sits within a high-strength magnetic field. Any objects containing ferrous metallic cannot be used within this magnetic field, including the typical response button boxes we use to collect behavioural decisions. At the scanner we use MRI safe button boxes that contain non-ferrous materials instead such as pneumatic and fibreoptic components.

At the same time, we often want to practice a task in the lab before a participant enters the MRI scanner. For that reason, Jacob has fabricated button boxes that very closely resemble the MRI safe ones but with standard electronics components that allow them to be plugged into lab computers for data collection. Above is an example of the <b>two button/two box</b> example for holding in each hand and below is a <b>four button/one box</b> example.

The cases are 3D printed, sanded, and spray painted. Electronics components are soldered or wired together using parts from online retailers like SparkFun and Adafruit.
